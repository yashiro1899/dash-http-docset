          <p><strong>HTTP</strong> is the protocol at the foundation of the Web. It has been invented by Tim Berners Lee in the years 1989-1991 and has seen numerous modifications since then, mostly keeping its original simplicity and building on its extensibility. HTTP has evolved from a protocol to exchange files in a trusted laboratory environment to the modern jungle of the Internet carrying images, videos in high resolution and in 3D.</p>

<h2 id="Invention_of_the_WWW">Invention of the WWW</h2>

<p>In 1989, Tim Berners Lee then working at CERN in Geneva, wrote a proposal to build an hypertext system over the Internet. Initially called the <em>Mesh</em>, it was renamed in <em>World Wide Web</em> during its implementation in 1990. Built over the existing TCP and IP protocols, it consisted of 4 building blocks:</p>

<ul>
 <li>A textual format to represent hypertext documents, <em>HTML</em>.</li>
 <li>A simple protocol to exchange such document, <em>HTTP</em>.</li>
 <li>A client to display (and accidentally edit) such document, the first Web browser called <em>WorldWideWeb</em>.</li>
 <li>A server to give access to the document, an early version of <em>httpd</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p>These four building blocks were completed by the end of 1990, and the first servers were running outside the CERN in early 1991. On August 6<sup>th</sup> 1991, Tim Berners Lee's <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/alt.hypertext/eCTkkOoWTAY/urNMgHnS2gYJ">post</a> on the public <em>alt.hypertext</em> newsgroupis considered as the official start of the World Wide Web as a public project.</p>

<p>The HTTP protocol used in these early phase was very simple and has been later called HTTP/0.9 and is dubbed the one-line protocol.</p>

<h2 id="HTTP0.9_–_The_one-line_protocol">HTTP/0.9 – The one-line protocol</h2>

<p>The initial version of HTTP has no version number. It has been called 0.9 to differentiate it from the later versions. It was extremely simple: request are one liners and starting with the only possible method {{HTTPMethod("GET")}} followed by the path to the ressource (not the URL as both the protocol, server, and port are unnecessary once connected to the server).</p>

<pre>GET /mypage.html</pre>

<p>The response was very simple too. It only consisted of the file itself:</p>

<pre>&lt;HTML&gt;
A very simple HTML page
&lt;/HTML&gt;</pre>

<p>Unlike subsequent evolution, there were no HTTP headers, meaning that only HTML files could be transmitted, no other type of documents. There were no status code or error code: in case of a problem, a specific HTML file was send back with the description of the problem contained in it, for human consumption.</p>

<h2 id="HTTP1.0_–_Building_extensibility">HTTP/1.0 – Building extensibility</h2>

<p>HTTP/0.9 was very limited and both browsers and servers extended it to be more versatile:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Versioning information is send with teach request (<code>HTTP/1.0</code> is appended to the <code>GET</code> line)</li>
 <li>An status code line is send at the beginning of the response, allowing the browser to understand the success or failure of the request and to behave accordingly (like in managing correctly its local cache!)</li>
 <li>The notion of HTTP Headers has been introduced, both for the request and the response, allowing meta-data to be transmitted and making the protocol incredibly flexible and extensible.</li>
 <li>Using these HTTP Headers, the ability to transmit other documents thant plain HTML files has been added (thanks to the {{HTTPHeader("Content-Type")}} header).</li>
</ul>

<p>A typical request was then looking like:</p>

<pre>GET /mypage.html HTTP/1.0
User-Agent: NCSA_Mosaic/2.0 (Windows 3.1)

200 OK
Date: Tue, 15 Nov 1994 08:12:31 GMT
Server: CERN/3.0 libwww/2.17
Content-Type: text/html
&lt;HTML&gt; 
A page with an image
  &lt;IMG SRC="/myimage.gif"&gt;
&lt;/HTML&gt;</pre>

<p>Followed by a second connection and request to fetch the image:</p>

<pre>GET /myimage.gif HTTP/1.0
User-Agent: NCSA_Mosaic/2.0 (Windows 3.1)

200 OK
Date: Tue, 15 Nov 1994 08:12:32 GMT
Server: CERN/3.0 libwww/2.17
Content-Type: text/gif
<em>(image content)</em></pre>

<p>These novelties have not been introduced as concerted effort, but as a try-and-see approach over the 1991-1995 period: a server and a browser added one feature and it saw if it get traction. A lot of interoperability problems were common. In November 1996, in order to solve these annoyances, an informational document describing the common practices has been published, {{RFC(1945)}}. This is the definition of HTTP/1.0 and it is notable that, stricto sensu, it isn't an official standard.</p>

<h2 id="HTTP1.1_–_The_standardized_protocol">HTTP/1.1 – The standardized protocol</h2>

<p>In parallel to the somewhat chaotic use of HTTP/1.0, and since 1995, well before the publication of {{RFC(1945)}} the next year, proper standardization was in progress. The first standardized version of HTTP, HTTP/1.1 was published in early 1997, only a few months after the HTTP/1.0 documents.</p>

<p>HTTP/1.1 clarified ambiguities and introduced numerous improvements:</p>

<ul>
 <li>A connection can be reused, saving the time to reopen it numerous times to display the resources embedded into the single original ducment retrieved.</li>
 <li>Pipelining has been added, allow to send a second request before the answer for the first one is fully transmitted, lowering the latency of the communication.</li>
 <li>Chunked responses are supported.</li>

<p>HTTP/1.1 was first published as {{rfc(2068)}} in January 1997.</p>

<h2 id="More_than_15_years_of_extensions">More than 15 years of extensions</h2>

<p>Thanks to its extensibility – creating new headers or methods is easy – and even if the HTTP/1.1 protocol was refined in two revisions, {{RFC("2616")}} published in June 1999 and the series of {{RFC("7230")}}-{{RFC("7235")}} published in June 2014 in prevision of the release of HTTP/2, this protocol has been extremely stable over more than 15 years.</p>

<h3 id="Transmission_over_TLS">Transmission over TLS</h3>

<p>The largest change that happened on HTTP started as early as end of 1994. Instead of sending HTTP over a basic TCP/IP stack, Netscape Communication created an additional encrypted transmission layer on top of it: SSL. SSL 1.0 was never released outside the companies, but SSL 2.0 and its successors SSL 3.0 and SSL 3.1 allowed for the creation of e-commerce Web sites by encrypting and guaranteeing the authenticity of the messages exchange between the server and client. SSL was put on the standard track and eventually became TLS, with version 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2 appearing successfully to close vulnerabilities. TLS 1.3 is currently in the making.</p>

<p>During the same time, the need for an encrypted transport layers raised: the Web left the relative trustiness of a mostly academic network, to the jungle of the modern Internet where advertisers, random individuals or criminals compete to get as much private information about people and try to impersonate them or even to replace data transmitted by altered one (often in order "to improve service"). As the applications built over HTTP became more and more powerful, having access to more and more private information like address books, e-mail, or the geographic position of the user, the need to have TLS became ubiquitous and HTTP/2 will make it mandatory to use an encrypted transport layer.</p>

<h3 id="Using_HTTP_for_complex_applications">Using HTTP for complex applications</h3>

<p>The original vision for the Web of Tim Berners Lee wasn't a read-only medium. He envisioned a Web were people can add and move document remotely, a kind of distributed file system. Around 1996, the HTTP protocol has been extended to allow authoring, WebDAV. It has been further extended for specific applications like CardDAV to handle with address book entries and CalDAV to deal with calendars. But these extensions had a flow: they had to be implemented by the servers to be used, which was quite complex. Their use on Web realms stayed confidential.</p>

<p>In 2000, a new pattern of using HTTP has been uncovered: representational state transfer (or REST). The API was no more conveyed by new HTTP methods with parameters, but by specific URIs, in conjunction with the standard HTTP/1.1. This allowed any Web application to provide an API, called a RESTful API, to allow retrieval and modification of its data without having to updated the browsers or the servers: all what is needed was embedded in the files serverd by the Web sites through standard HTTP/1.1. The drawback of the REST models reside in the fact that the Web site defines its own non-standard RESTful API and has total control on it, unlike the *DAV extensions where clients and servers are interoperable. RESTful APIs became very common in the 2010s.</p>

<p>Since 2005, the set of APIs available to Web pages greatly increased and several of these APIs created extension, mostly new specific HTTP headers,  to the HTTP protocol for specific purposes:</p>

<ul>
 <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events">Server-sent events</a> where the server can push occasional messages to the browser.</li>
 <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSocket_API">WebSocket</a> is a new protocol that can be set up by upgrading an existing HTTP connection.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Web_origin_and_security-related_headers">Web origin and security-related headers</h3>

<p>HTTP is independant of the security model of the Web, called the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy">same-origin policy</a>. In fact, the current Web security model has been developed after the creation of the Web. Over the years, it has proved useful to be able to be more lenient, by allowing, under certain constraints, to lift some of the restriction of this policy. How much and when is transmitted by the server to the client using new HTTP headers. These are defined in specifications like <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/CORS">Cross-Origin Ressource Sharing</a> (CORS) or the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/CSP">Content Security Policy</a> (CSP).</p>

<p>In addition to these large extensions, numerous small headers have been added, sometimes experimentally only. Notably we can speak about the Do Not Track ({{HTTPHeader("DNT")}}) header to control privacy, {{HTTPHeader("X-Frame-Options")}}, or {{HTTPHeader('Upgrade-Insecure-Request')}} but many more exist.</p>

<h2 id="HTTP2_–_A_protocol_for_greater_performance">HTTP/2 – A protocol for greater performance</h2>

<p>Over the years, Web pages became much more complex, being often true applications. The amount of media displayed, as well as the amount and size of the script, increased a lot: many more data were transmitted over many requests. HTTP/1.1 connections need requests send by order and if several parallel connections could be used, typically between 5 and 8, there was still a lot of overhead and of complexity. Pipelining for example proved to be a deployment nightmare.</p>

<p>In the first half of the 2010s, Google showed alternative way of exchanging data between client and server, by implementing the experimental SPDY/2.0 protocol. It fosters a lot of interest both on the browser and server manufacturer sides, proving that better responsiveness and solving the duplication of data transmitted problem, and served at the basis of the HTTP/2 protocol.</p>

<p>The HTTP/2 protocol is fundamentally different from the HTTP/1.1:</p>

<ul>
 <li>It is a binary protocol rather than a text protocol. It cannot be read and created by hand anymore; in exchange more optimization techniques could be implemented.</li>
 <li>It is a multiplexed protocol, where parallel requests can be handled over the same connection, removing the order and blocking constraint of the HTTP/1.x protocols</li>
 <li>It compresses headers as these are often very similar between consecutives requests, removing significant duplication of data transmitted and the unneeded overhead induced by it.</li>
 <li>It allows a server to populate a client cache in advance with data that will likely be needed, by a mechanism called server pushes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Officially standardized in May 2015, HTTP/2 had a great success: in July 2016, 8.7% of all Web sites<sup><a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/ce-http2/all/all">[1]</a></sup> are already using it, but this represents more than 68% of all requests<sup><a href="https://www.keycdn.com/blog/http2-statistics/">[2]</a></sup> as high-traffic Web sites, that save a lot of money by the win in decrease of the overhead transmitted on the wire, have adopted it extremely rapidly.</p>

<p>This rapid adoption was possible as HTTP/2 doesn't need an adaptation of the Web sites and applications: using HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/2 is transparent for them. Having an up-to-date server speaking with a recent browser is enough to enable its use: only a few limited set of actors were needed to trigger its adoption and as old browser and server versions are replaced, its usage increased naturally, without Web developers needing to act.</p>

      <div id="doc-source">
        <pre class="brush:js">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HTTP&lt;/strong&gt; is the protocol at the foundation of the Web. It has been invented by Tim Berners Lee in the years 1989-1991 and has seen numerous modifications since then, mostly keeping its original simplicity and building on its extensibility. HTTP has evolved from a protocol to exchange files in a trusted laboratory environment to the modern jungle of the Internet carrying images, videos in high resolution and in 3D.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;Invention_of_the_WWW&#34;&gt;Invention of the WWW&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1989, Tim Berners Lee then working at CERN in Geneva, wrote a proposal to build an hypertext system over the Internet. Initially called the &lt;em&gt;Mesh&lt;/em&gt;, it was renamed in &lt;em&gt;World Wide Web&lt;/em&gt; during its implementation in 1990. Built over the existing TCP and IP protocols, it consisted of 4 building blocks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;A textual format to represent hypertext documents, &lt;em&gt;HTML&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;A simple protocol to exchange such document, &lt;em&gt;HTTP&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;A client to display (and accidentally edit) such document, the first Web browser called &lt;em&gt;WorldWideWeb&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;A server to give access to the document, an early version of &lt;em&gt;httpd&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These four building blocks were completed by the end of 1990, and the first servers were running outside the CERN in early 1991. On August 6&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; 1991, Tim Berners Lee&#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/alt.hypertext/eCTkkOoWTAY/urNMgHnS2gYJ&#34;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; on the public &lt;em&gt;alt.hypertext&lt;/em&gt; newsgroupis considered as the official start of the World Wide Web as a public project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The HTTP protocol used in these early phase was very simple and has been later called HTTP/0.9 and is dubbed the one-line protocol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;HTTP0.9_–_The_one-line_protocol&#34;&gt;HTTP/0.9 – The one-line protocol&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initial version of HTTP has no version number. It has been called 0.9 to differentiate it from the later versions. It was extremely simple: request are one liners and starting with the only possible method {{HTTPMethod(&#34;GET&#34;)}} followed by the path to the ressource (not the URL as both the protocol, server, and port are unnecessary once connected to the server).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
GET /mypage.html&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The response was very simple too. It only consisted of the file itself:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
&amp;lt;HTML&amp;gt;
A very simple HTML page
&amp;lt;/HTML&amp;gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike subsequent evolution, there were no HTTP headers, meaning that only HTML files could be transmitted, no other type of documents. There were no status code or error code: in case of a problem, a specific HTML file was send back with the description of the problem contained in it, for human consumption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;HTTP1.0_–_Building_extensibility&#34;&gt;HTTP/1.0 – Building extensibility&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HTTP/0.9 was very limited and both browsers and servers extended it to be more versatile:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Versioning information is send with teach request (&lt;code&gt;HTTP/1.0&lt;/code&gt; is appended to the &lt;code&gt;GET&lt;/code&gt; line)&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;An status code line is send at the beginning of the response, allowing the browser to understand the success or failure of the request and to behave accordingly (like in managing correctly its local cache!)&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;The notion of HTTP Headers has been introduced, both for the request and the response, allowing meta-data to be transmitted and making the protocol incredibly flexible and extensible.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Using these HTTP Headers, the ability to transmit other documents thant plain HTML files has been added (thanks to the {{HTTPHeader(&#34;Content-Type&#34;)}} header).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A typical request was then looking like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
GET /mypage.html HTTP/1.0
User-Agent: NCSA_Mosaic/2.0 (Windows 3.1)

200 OK
Date: Tue, 15 Nov 1994 08:12:31 GMT
Server: CERN/3.0 libwww/2.17
Content-Type: text/html
&amp;lt;HTML&amp;gt; 
A page with an image
  &amp;lt;IMG SRC=&#34;/myimage.gif&#34;&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/HTML&amp;gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Followed by a second connection and request to fetch the image:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
GET /myimage.gif HTTP/1.0
User-Agent: NCSA_Mosaic/2.0 (Windows 3.1)

200 OK
Date: Tue, 15 Nov 1994 08:12:32 GMT
Server: CERN/3.0 libwww/2.17
Content-Type: text/gif
&lt;em&gt;(image content)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These novelties have not been introduced as concerted effort, but as a try-and-see approach over the 1991-1995 period: a server and a browser added one feature and it saw if it get traction. A lot of interoperability problems were common. In November 1996, in order to solve these annoyances, an informational document describing the common practices has been published, {{RFC(1945)}}. This is the definition of HTTP/1.0 and it is notable that, stricto sensu, it isn&#39;t an official standard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;HTTP1.1_–_The_standardized_protocol&#34;&gt;HTTP/1.1 – The standardized protocol&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In parallel to the somewhat chaotic use of HTTP/1.0, and since 1995, well before the publication of {{RFC(1945)}} the next year, proper standardization was in progress. The first standardized version of HTTP, HTTP/1.1 was published in early 1997, only a few months after the HTTP/1.0 documents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HTTP/1.1 clarified ambiguities and introduced numerous improvements:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;A connection can be reused, saving the time to reopen it numerous times to display the resources embedded into the single original ducment retrieved.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Pipelining has been added, allow to send a second request before the answer for the first one is fully transmitted, lowering the latency of the communication.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Chunked responses are supported.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Cache control mechanisms have been introduced.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Content negotiation, including language, have been introduced allowing a client and a server to agree on the most adequate content to exchange.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;The ability to host different domain a the same IP address, allowing for server collocation, thanks to the {{HTTPHeader(&#34;Host&#34;)}} header.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A typical flow of requests, all through one single connection is looking like:&lt;/p&gt;

Having an up-to-date server speaking with a recent browser is enough to enable its use: only a few limited set of actors were needed to trigger its adoption and as old browser and server versions are replaced, its usage increased naturally, without Web developers needing to act.&lt;/p&gt;
